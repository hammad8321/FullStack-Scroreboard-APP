# 🏆 Scoreboard Application

A **full-stack scoreboard application** built with **React + TypeScript** for the frontend and a RESTful API (e.g., ASP.NET Core) for the backend.  
It allows users to manage players, track their scores, add new players, update scores, and remove players — with all data persisted to the backend.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📥 **Load Players** – Fetch existing players from the backend API.
- ➕ **Add Player** – Add new players with an initial score of `0`.
- 🔼🔽 **Update Scores** – Increment or decrement scores in real time.
- ❌ **Remove Player** – Delete players from the scoreboard and database.
- ⚡ **Instant UI Updates** – Reflect backend changes immediately in the UI.
- ✅ **Type Safety** – Built using TypeScript with `PlayerType` interface.
